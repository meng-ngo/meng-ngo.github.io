      <description>&amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.&amp;rdquo; Jimmy Dean
This is a concept that Meng was built on and we live by it every day. We can&amp;rsquo;t change the whole world at once but we can control our actions. Having the right goals in mind, and pushing towards those goals one step at a time is the key for a sustainable development in the community.</description>

      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>We are a group of young people who graduated from university and decided to make their city a better place.
WHAT INSPIRED US Being in a region that is far from being stable, our post university lives weren&amp;rsquo;t at all what we expected. Most of us finished school in 2014 - 2015, the years terrorism was tearing through the region. Big companies left, and our economy fell. We saw people suffering, starving, and everything was falling apart.</description>
