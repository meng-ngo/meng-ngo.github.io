      <description>&amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination.&amp;rdquo; Jimmy Dean
This is a concept that Meng was built on and we live by it every day. We can&amp;rsquo;t change the whole world at once but we can control our actions. Having the right goals in mind, and pushing towards those goals one step at a time is the key for a sustainable development in the community.</description>
